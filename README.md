Instructions to Run Robot Program- By Saurabh Sakpal
1) Program is written in Python, to run this program you must have python or python3 installed or have a python environment
2) There is only 1 file  (Robotprogram.py)
3) To run save the file to a location (e.g C:\Desktop), cd (change directory) to that location, and then in terminal (or whichever environment you use e.g powershell/mac terminal etc.) and type;
3) a) EDIT: I have now added it to github, you can simply git clone the directory to your respective location
python Robotprogram.py 
4) This will run the python script/file
5) Once the program is running it will initiate you to Enter Coordinates (X and Y) and Direction
6) Enter Coordinates: It has to be between (0,0) and (5,5) if outside it will prompt a error message, Direction has to be East, West, South or North, it can be typed in any case (lower or upper)
7) Once that is done your robot is on the board and you can run the commands you want
8) If robot is attempting to move out of grid a error message will pop up saying (‘Robot out of grid’)
9) Commands are: ‘Move’, ‘Left’, ‘Right’, ‘Place’ (this command will prompt you to enter new x and y co-ordinates) and ‘Report’, which will report the co-ordinates. Commands can be in any case lowercase or uppercase, e.g ‘move’ or ‘MOVE’.
